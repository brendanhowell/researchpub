## diary

produced test html with all the features

tried pandoc: 

pandoc index.html --self-contained -o standalone/index.html

much of my HTML gets overwritten.

tried https://github.com/jgm/standalone-html

doesn't work with background images

So I was wondering whether I can only use the --self-contained engine on the existing HTML file.
